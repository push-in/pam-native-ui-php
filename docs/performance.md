# Performance evidence

PAM Native UI keeps interaction progress inside Android and sends PHP only the
semantic result. Benchmarks are split by layer so a fast PHP microbenchmark
cannot be mistaken for smooth rendered frames.

Release evidence also distinguishes source correctness from package
reproducibility. The release workflow constructs the PHP and iOS source
archives twice from the same immutable Git tree, performs two clean Android AAR
builds, and compares every pair byte for byte before checksums, provenance or
publication. Cross-job archives expire after seven days; durable downloads live
on the GitHub release.

Each comparison also emits a bounded schema-1 JSON report with sequential
integer artifact/result codes, byte count and SHA-256. The publish job streams
the downloaded packages again and rejects missing, substituted, symlinked,
oversized or malformed evidence before creating the release.

Artifact codes are `1` for the iOS source ZIP, `2` for the Android AAR and `3`
for the PHP source archive. Result code `1` means passed and `2` means a byte
mismatch; the producer and verifier use the corresponding integer enums.

The same artifact codes feed package-size budgets: 1 MiB for iOS source, 8 MiB
for the Android AAR and 4 MiB for PHP source. These are release safety ceilings,
not app download/install-size claims. Schema-1 reports bind actual bytes, limit,
result code and SHA-256, are provenance-attested, and are recomputed from the
downloaded artifacts immediately before publication.

The portable source-archive check is available locally:

```bash
tools/test-reproducible-archive.sh
```

The same boundary applies to UIKit. `p-ripple`, state layers, overlay motion,
intersection, resize and mutation observation execute in native code. Only
requested semantic events cross the bounded binary channel; listeners are
absent when a directive is not authored.

The complete rerun on the same device passed on 2026-07-24. Its machine-readable
result is checked in at
[`benchmarks/android-sm-s918b-api36-2026-07-24.json`](../benchmarks/android-sm-s918b-api36-2026-07-24.json).
All 24 measured operation families stayed below their enforced p99 budget;
notable results include tabs at 42 µs, menu selection at 6 µs, sheet snapping
at 504 µs, rich markdown updates at 127 µs, and table layout at 2 µs.

A second run on Android 12/API 31 using a Samsung Galaxy S10 passed all 39
functional instrumentation tests and all performance gates. This older-device
evidence is stored separately in
[`benchmarks/android-sm-g973f-api31-2026-07-24.json`](../benchmarks/android-sm-g973f-api31-2026-07-24.json);
it is not mixed into the Galaxy S23 reference baseline.

Both checked-in results now implement the versioned
[`device-evidence.schema.json`](../benchmarks/device-evidence.schema.json)
contract and are executable release inputs rather than free-form examples.
Platform `1` is Android; build types `1` and `2` are debug and release;
measurement coverage `1` is historical p99-only and `2` is complete
p50/p95/p99/max; result `1` is passed and `2` is failed. Each report binds its
capture date and exact 40-character source revision without inventing missing
historical quantiles. Every measurement carries its own `sampleCount`;
`samplesPerOperation` is retained as the largest count in the run and must
equal the maximum of those exact per-metric values. This preserves the real
2,000 calendar/lifecycle samples instead of presenting them as 10,000.

CI and tagged releases run the dependency-free verifier against the current
21-operation inventory. The three image-navigation, message-branch and prompt
measurements remain accepted only as one complete historical extension because
those hosts were consolidated after the July capture; partial mixtures fail.
The verifier rejects unknown/missing fields, string codes,
failed functional tests, duplicate device/API/date evidence, incomplete
quantiles, non-monotonic samples, symlinks, oversized reports, and p99 at or
above 4 ms (8 ms for lifecycle). Reproduce the evidence gate without building
the app:

```bash
python3 benchmarks/verify-device-evidence.py benchmarks/android-*.json
python3 -m unittest discover -s benchmarks -p 'test_*device_evidence.py'
```

This gate proves the integrity and stated budget of recorded runs. It cannot
prove that an old JSON was captured on the named hardware; future device jobs
must attach signed runner/device provenance before that stronger claim is made.

The 10,000 slider moves emitted zero per-move bridge callbacks and one final
semantic `CHANGE` event. This is a 10,000:1 reduction versus an implementation
that sends every sampled movement across the language boundary; it is not a
claim that PAM is 10,000 times faster than another framework.

The 2,000 calendar frames drew the complete six-week range state, today
indicator and disabled dates directly into an Android canvas with zero bridge
events. The 10,000 DateTimePicker updates parsed limits, time-zone offsets and
changing ISO values on the native UI thread with zero bridge events. The
10,000 Accordion state changes each emitted exactly one final semantic toggle;
content visibility and animation do not emit frame callbacks. Checkbox and
RadioGroup each emitted exactly 10,000 semantic events while drawing state and,
for radio, unchecking the sibling locally without an extra bridge callback.
The instrumented benchmark fails when update, DateTimePicker update, Accordion
toggle, Checkbox toggle, RadioGroup selection, gesture or calendar draw p99
exceeds 4 ms, or lifecycle p99 exceeds 8 ms. Run it on a connected device:

```bash
../pam-native/android/gradlew \
  -p android \
  connectedDebugAndroidTest \
  -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.class=dev.pam.mobileui.MobileUiHostPerformanceInstrumentedTest
```

The raw JSON result is logged under `PamMobileUiBench`. Do not copy that line by
hand. From a clean committed checkout with exactly one authorized physical
device, capture the full instrumented suite and turn its log plus JUnit results
into a new canonical report with:

```bash
tools/capture-android-device-evidence.sh \
  benchmarks/android-device-apiNN-YYYY-MM-DD.json
```

The command refuses dirty worktrees, existing output files, multiple devices,
missing/duplicate benchmark payloads, partial quantiles, and any failed,
errored or skipped instrumentation case. It binds the current Git revision and
date, then immediately reruns the independent verifier. Gradle's user and
project caches are redirected into `.pam-device-capture`; the command removes
that directory and the regenerable `android/build` output on every exit so a
physical capture does not leave another unbounded build cache behind.

The current benchmark source additionally gates 10,000 native sheet snap
changes and 10,000 sheet-item activations at p99 below 4 ms, with exactly one
semantic event per operation. Those two rows will be added to the reference
table only after a new physical-device run; static compilation is not reported
as measured runtime evidence.

The same pending physical run now includes 10,000 collision-aware anchored
layouts and 10,000 Menu selections. Positioning must emit zero bridge events;
each Menu activation must emit exactly one semantic event. Both use the same
p99 below 4 ms gate and remain excluded from the reference table until measured
on hardware.

Compound inputs add two more pending hardware gates: 10,000 focus/invalid state
updates with zero bridge events, and 10,000 native slot activations with exactly
one semantic press each. Clear and password visibility mutate the mounted
`EditText` directly; normal typing follows the selected native/debounced/blur/
submit synchronization policy. These rows also remain excluded from the
reference table until a physical run records them.

The pending physical suite also lays out a 20-row by 4-column semantic table
10,000 times. Its cached accessibility coordinates must keep steady-layout p99
below 4 ms and emit zero bridge events. Scalar `FlatList`, `VirtualizedList`
and `SectionList` use PAM core's RecyclerView host, recycled pool and bounded
GapWorker prefetch; an end-to-end scroll and memory profile remains part of the
full-renderer benchmark rather than this plugin-host microbenchmark.

The same suite performs 10,000 paired steady updates of a multi-line Skeleton
and persistent Toast. The single pulse animator and identity-stable timer must
keep p99 below 4 ms with zero bridge events; the result remains excluded from
the reference table until measured on hardware.

FileTree adds a pending 10,000-toggle gate below 4 ms p99. Each folder
activation performs its selection and expansion updates locally and emits
exactly two semantic results (selected path plus bounded expansion map);
animation frames never cross the bridge.

The unified vertical/horizontal ScrollView adds a pending native fling and
10,000 property-update gate. Drag, momentum, paging and snap remain inside the
core Android host; registered scroll progress is coalesced to one scalar per
display frame, while an unobserved scroll emits zero bridge events. Static
compilation is not reported as physical runtime evidence.

The image pipeline adds pending cold/warm/cache-hit gates for 1,000 mixed
avatar, card and background requests. The physical-device run must record
deduplicated network count, disk-hit ratio, decoded allocation, cancellation
correctness, main-thread mount time and frame p95/p99. A 4096 px source used in
a 40 dp avatar must decode to the nearest bounded target bucket rather than its
full dimensions. Progress may cross at most once per display frame when
observed; images without lifecycle handlers emit zero bridge events.

Inputs add a pending 10,000-keystroke and 1,000-field focus/selection gate.
Native and blur/submit sync modes must preserve every character and cursor
position with zero per-keystroke PHP callbacks; observed selection may emit at
most once per display frame. The run records IME latency, dropped characters,
main-thread p95/p99 and bridge event counts on physical hardware.

Grid adds a pending 10,000-layout gate using responsive columns, mixed spans,
independent row/column gaps and two wrapped rows. Breakpoint selection,
measurement, RTL mirroring and placement must remain below 4 ms p99 with zero
bridge events; this row stays excluded until recorded on physical hardware.

## PHP composition and binary encoding

The reference local run composed a realistic styled form subtree and encoded
the complete PAM binary tree 2,000 times per sample. The table reports the
median of five measured samples after the benchmark's 100-tree warm-up:

| Metric | Result |
| --- | ---: |
| Median total | 996.910 ms |
| Median throughput | 2,006.2 trees/s |
| Encoded frame | 2,148 bytes |
| Peak PHP memory | 8 MiB |
| PHP | 8.4.23 |

Reference host: Intel Core Ultra 9 185H, 22 logical CPUs, 30 GiB RAM, Linux
7.0.11 x86-64. The five measured totals were 1,096.115 ms, 974.398 ms,
981.180 ms, 1,042.991 ms and 996.910 ms.

Reproduce it with `composer benchmark`.

## Claim boundary

These measurements validate bounded host work and the absence of per-frame PHP
traffic on one high-end physical device. They do not yet establish an end-to-end
speedup over React Native Nitro Modules. Cold start, mount/update through the
full PAM renderer, frame p50/p95/p99, jank, memory and matched-device competitor
baselines remain required before the performance gate can move from `planned`
to `verified`.
